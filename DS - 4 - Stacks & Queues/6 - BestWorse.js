Stacks & Queues

Good:
- Fast Operations
- Fast Peek
- Ordered

Bad:
- Slow Lookup

/*
    Stacks          Queues
Lookup O(n)*        Lookup  O(n)*
Pop    O(1)         enqueue O(1)
Push   O(1)         Dequeue O(1)
Peek   O(1)         Peek    O(1)

* -> Stacks and Queues don't have lookup methods, but if we implement these, they will be O(n).
