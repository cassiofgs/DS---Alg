Graphs

Good:
- Relationships

Bad:
- Scaling is hard

Big O is complex, because it depends on lots of variable, such types of grapsh and how they will be used.

So the main point, is RELATIONSHIPS, where relationships are key, and you will need them, graphs will be
the option, even if they don't have the best space time complexity.
