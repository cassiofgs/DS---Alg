//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
// Answers may vary, BFS probably but...
// BFS we need to have some memory concerns
// DFS will take long - If solutions are frequent, DFS can be the choice

//If the tree is very wide:
// Answer may vary, DFS probably but...
// DFS
// BFS will need too much memory

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
// BFS
