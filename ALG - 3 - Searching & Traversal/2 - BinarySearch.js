/*
Binary Search

On a sorted data structure, we can check for the middle value (in array) or node value in a BST
and discard half of the values according with it the value of the node is greater or lower and
doing this for each node we go, so this way we can find the value without check every item.

Best        O(1)
Average     O(log(n))
Worst       O(log(n))
Space       O(1)
