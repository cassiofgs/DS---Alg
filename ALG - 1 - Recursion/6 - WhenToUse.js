/*
In tough problems, like Searching and Sorting.
In more complicated Data Structures like Trees and Graphs.

NEW RULE:
Every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree, consider recursion
1 - Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2 - Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature.
3 - The solutions of each subproblem can be recombined to solve the problem at hand.
Divide and Conquer using Recursion
