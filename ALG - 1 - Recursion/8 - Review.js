/*
Recursion is a function that call herself.

It should be used to make code more readable.

But we have to take care of the memory space it will consume, and to not fail to meet the base case, if 
that occur we will end up with a stack overflow.

Also, recursion can have worst space time complexity then iterative in some cases, so we need to be aware

Anything you do with a recursion CAN be done iteratively, so it is up to us to know the pros and cons,
and use it apropertly.
