/*
So, programing languages, came with pre built sorting functions.

const letters = ['b', 'z', 'a', 'f', 'r'];
letters.sort();

And that is ok for simple use, but think in companies like, Google, Amazon and companies that need
to sort a huge amount of data, using this pre built sort operations will be ineficient, and cost a lot
of money and computer power.

So they need to implement their custom and optmized sorting functions, and that is why we need to learn
about how to make this algorithms, so we can make the company we are working, more eficient (and lucrative)

The more used and that we have to be familiar with are:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
